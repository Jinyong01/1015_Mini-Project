# SC1015 Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
Welcome to our SC1015 Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Mini-project between Jin Yong (U2322914J) and Ryan (U2321286F). We are working on the Stroke Prediction Dataset. For more details, you may view our jupyter notebook where we have visuals, along with numbers and notes to aid in understanding our data analysis more.

## Problem Statement:
According to the World Health Organization's 2022 report, stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death globally. Shockingly, statistics show that one in four individuals aged 25 and above will experience a stroke in their lifetime. Moreover, there has been a concerning 70% increase in stroke risk from 1990 to 2019, leading to a 43% surge in stroke-related deaths.

## Understanding the Challenge:
It's evident that many individuals are unaware of the factors contributing to stroke incidence. Annually, an estimated 15 million people suffer from strokes. However, early intervention can significantly reduce the likelihood of stroke occurrence and enhance overall quality of life, potentially decreasing healthcare costs associated with treatment.

## Problem Definition:
Are we able to identify the contributing factors that cause a stroke to happen?

## Models Used:
1. Decision Classification Tree
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest

## Conclusion/Outcome:
1. Developed a predictive model that achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.7% in identifying stroke risk based on a comprehensive set of features including:
   1. Age
   2. Gender
   3. Various health-related factors such as hypertension, heart disease, marital status, occupation, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status.

    By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can effectively predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke.

3. Our analysis reveals a clear association between age and stroke risk, with older individuals exhibiting a higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke.
4. Additionally, our findings suggest that gender may play a role in stroke susceptibility, with females appearing to be at higher risk compared to males.

## Takeaways from this project:
1. Collaborating with GitHub
2. Finding new methods and models to tackle unproportionate datasets
3. Using resampling to handle imbalanced dataset
4. Logistic Regression & Random Forest
